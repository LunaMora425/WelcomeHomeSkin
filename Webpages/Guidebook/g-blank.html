<h1>The Blank</h1>
<p><b>Population: Unknown</b></p>
<p>
 What appears to be mere forestland is a space far stranger: anyone who ventures too far into the thicket will simply arrive at the other side of
 town, though it can take someone ten minutes or ten hours to make their way out. Anyone is taking a risk if they venture too far past the tree line
 into The Blank.
</p>
<p>
 If someone wanders in far enough that they can no longer see the fields surrounding Town, they will become lost. If they keep moving, they will find
 their way out eventually. However, beyond the natural risks of being attacked by a wild animal or succumbing to exposure if inadequately prepared,
 bad luck seems to follow anyone who gets lost in The Blank.
</p>

<h2>Phenomena of the Blank</h2>

<p>
 While the Town and the Commune appear to be more stable in terms of geography and physics, the Blank is much more unstable. The geography shifts.
 Strange creatures appear. The deeper you go, the more likely you are to be attacked by the creatures within it, which may be as simple as a normal
 wolf, or perhaps something much more ominous. Here are some things to know about the Blank.
</p>

<h3>KNOWN IN-CHARACTER</h3>

<ol>
 <li>
  You can't get out on your own. You will go as far as The Watcher wants you to go before you read the midpoint of your journey and begin coming out
  the other side of the forest.
 </li>

 <li>
  People who get separated from one another (i.e. they lose sight of one another) will have different experiences of The Blank, including its length,
  and they will not be able to find each other again.
 </li>

 <li>
  Horrors that can occur in the Blank include animal attacks (from wolves, bears, and mountain lions), animals behaving in strange ways, unexplained
  structures, hallucinations, and discovering strange objects. The geography within the Blank is constantly shifting, and thus it cannot be mapped.
 </li>
</ol>

<h3>KNOWN OUT-OF-CHARACTER</h3>

<ol>
 <li>
  The deeper a person is allowed/forced to go, the more likely they are to encounter an anomaly. Going still further, the anomaly is more likely to be
  violent and/or supernatural. "Getting lost" can be its own anomaly via experiencing shifting geography, e.g. the river outside the Blank flows North
  to South, but following the river will not lead you out.
 </li>

 <li>
  Technically the Blank does have a "center", but getting there would take a matter of weeks and permission from the Watcher. The center of the Blank
  is from which all horror in Home emanates. A violent death is much more likely than being able to reach this point. '
 </li>

 <li>
  Damaging parts of the Blank (such as chopping down trees) causes the Blank to become more unstable. At this time, there's a buffer zone (aka, an
  invisible barrier) between the Meadows and the Blank, where you lose visibility of the tree line.
