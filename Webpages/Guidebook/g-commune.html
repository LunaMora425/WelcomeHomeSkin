<h2>The Commune</h2>
<p><b>Population: 340</b></p>

<p>
 The compound of Saint Leyla and her adherents, The Commune is on the west side of Town. The Commune is responsible for nearly all of the agriculture
 in Home, so they have a tenuous relationship with the other residents of Town, who in turn provide many of the goods and services that the members of
 The Commune require. Anyone is welcome to join The Commune, and in exchange receive shelter and three meals a day. There's just one thing they ask in
 returnâ€¦
</p>

<p>Notable Commune locations:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <u>Leyla's Residence:</u> The center home on the row of homes closest to The Meadows, Leyla's home looks out onto The Farm. Leyla has a porch swing
  on her patio.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>No Man's Land:</u> the blocks immediately surrounding the Commune have been abandoned by Town so there is a dead zone/buffer between Commune and
  Town
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Farm</h2>
<p>
 Run by The Commune, The Farm is to the west of Town. Here, there are fields, gardens, an orchard and plenty of pasture. The Farm has a coop of 60
 egg-laying hens, 10 roosters, 12 dairy cows, 2 bulls, a flock of 20 sheep and 5 goats. The Farm was collectively managed by the people of the Town
 until St. Leyla and her cult instituted a hostile takeover of the Farm.
