<h1>The Watcher</h1>

<p>
 The Watcher is the unknown entity which selected all the residents and placed them in Home. Through the powers, miracles, and artifacts it blessed
 people with, the Watcher has revealed both deeply personal knowledge of people and a desire to exacerbate their worst impulses. The placidity of Home
 is a nightmare unfolding.
</p>
<p>The Watcher sees all, but its motives remain unclear. One thing, however, should be known. The Watcher wants you to suffer.</p>

<h1>OOC Notes</h1>

<p>
 Let us be clear now: the Watcher enjoys pain, suffering, torment, and tragedy. It desires conflict. It relishes discomfort. Imagine this as the
 constant background mechanic of Home. Why did you get that magic coffee drop? Maybe you said something mean to a neighbor shortly before it. Maybe
 you thought something particularly wicked. Consider that the Watcher 'rewards' malfeasance.
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand, the Watcher intends to inflict scarcity. Trying to turn your lawn into a garden? The seedlings may never sprout. The sprouts might
 simply wither and die. In-character this is one reason that some things are oddly difficult to accomplish, almost like the residents are being
 thwarted.
</p>
<p>There is a hostility in the world. It wants you to fight. It wants life to be difficult. It wants the bad guys to win.</p>
<p>
 At this time, there is no way to directly communicate with the Watcher, and its location -- if it can even be said to exist in a single location --
 is unknown. 'The Watcher' is simply the title that the residents of Home have given to what they can only imagine is a thing with will, power, and
 intent.
