<h1>Application Information</h1>

<p>
	The information you enter for your character under the application is up to you: you can tell us as much or as little
	about your character as you'd like. You can even lie.
</p>
<p>
	Think about your character profile as public knowledge about your character. If your character has secrets, you are
	allowed to protect them. But secrets can be hard to keep.
</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>
	Here's where you'd put any <u>public</u> information about your character's powers, such as those granted by an
	ability or an artifact. You are allowed to "bluff" by listing powers your character doesn't have, or you can omit
	powers/weaknesses your character does have if you intend to keep it a secret.
</p>
<h2>Freeform</h2>
<p>
	Please provide a minimum of 200 words but no more than 1,000 words. Include information about how your character died
	as well as what they have done in the year since their arrival in Home. You do not need to include "backstory" about
	your character's life before they came to Home. You can be truthful in your freeform, or treat this as your
	character's "cover story" -- the image they project to the public.
</p>
<h2>Plot Hooks</h2>
<p>
	Please include three plot hooks that can start the plotting process! These can be relationships, plot events, etc., to
	help connect your character to other characters in Home.
</p>
<h2>The Truth</h2>
<p>
	The Truth section should include the following: your character's gift (if it is not accurately reflected in your
	public profile), a full detailing of their powers/weaknesses (if applicable), and your character's cause of death (if
	different than that detailed in their freeform.) Anything else that isn't true can be revealed through plotting.
</p>
