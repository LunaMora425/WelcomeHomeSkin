<h1>Seasons & Weather</h1>

<h2>Day / Night Cycle</h2>

<p>
 Home has no sun, moon, or stars in the "sky." There is phenomena that resembles a sunrise/sunset cycle where night transitions into day, which can be
 most approximated to a dimmer switch in the sky with an orangey-red undertone. “Sunrise” and “sunset” colors can include cyan, purple and pink tones.
 The cycle follows approximately a 1 hour dawn, an 11 hour day, a 1 hour dusk, and an 11 hour night*. This does not change season to season.
</p>

<h2>Weather</h2>

<p>There is a range of weather in Home (see below). There are sometimes clouds in the sky.</p>

<h2>Seasons</h2>

<p>Home has a hemiboreal climate…for now, with the following seasons:</p>

<p>
 <u>Winter:</u> Winters are cold and windy, with frequent snowfall. It may occasionally hail or sleet. Temperatures often dip to 20F/-7C during the
 day, and to -5F/-20C during the night. The grass and meadow becomes dry and brown; the trees in The Blank are evergreen. The River does not freeze,
 but The Lake inside The Blank will sometimes be frozen over, with the thickness of the ice difficult to determine.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Spring:</u> Springs are cool, with frequent rainfall and occasional snow. The cycle of snowmelt and refreezing, as well as heavy rains, makes the
 environment soggy and muddy outside of Town, especially in The Blank. Temperatures can get up to 50F/10C during the day as the season progresses
 towards Summer, and drop to 15F/-10C during the night. During spring, the meadow starts to get greener, and the crops on The Farm start to sprout.
 Some early wildflowers begin to sprout. During this time, The River swells with snowmelt and gets much wider and higher.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Summer:</u> Summers are warm but not often hot, with occasional rainfall. The air can be humid. Temperatures can get up to 85F/30C during the
 height of summer, and drop to 50F/10C during the night. The environment during summer is very green, with a rotation of seasonal crops on The Farm,
 and during the height of summer in ideal conditions, the meadows may experience a super bloom of wildflowers.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Fall:</u> Falls are mild and occasionally windy, with little rainfall. Temperatures can get up to 70F/20C during the day as the season moves away
 from Summer, and drop to 15F/-10C during the night as winter approaches. There are not any deciduous trees outside of those planted around Town and
 those in The Orchard, but those trees will have their leaves turn gold, orange and red before they brown and drop off the trees as the weather cools.
 During Fall, The Farm will have its harvest season, during which winter stores will be distributed before the agricultural period ends. The grasses
 in the meadow and on the lawn will eventually brown as the season grows colder.

<h2>A Note on Months, Days, Hours and Minutes</h2>

<p>
 The Council has been keeping track of days according to the Gregorian Calendar. Visit Town Hall to know which day The Council [i]claims[/i] it is.
 Characters are not obligated to use this time-telling system if they've developed something else that works for them already. We mark our months
 using Gregorian Calendar months, e.g., “September,” but this is a shorthand to keep track of time and merely reflects The Council's assumption of
 what the calendar operates like in Home.
</p>

<p>
 Additionally, characters do not have the means to keep time. Aside from the dawn/dusk cycle, there is no way to determine what time it is, as there
 is no sun to track in the sky. The best characters can do is use their impressions of how much time has passed, and use dawn/dusk as markers. E.g.,
 the shops on Main Street may be expected to open “soon” after sunrise (e.g., as long as it takes a reasonable person to shower, dress and prepare
 breakfast), a shop may close at the first sign of dusk. Once again, hours, minutes, etc can be used as narrative shorthand, but your character should
 not be aware that "it's been two hours” or be able to say "meet me at the Town Square at 3:00 PM."
