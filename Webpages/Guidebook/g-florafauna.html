<p><b>What wildlife lives in Home?</b></p>

<p>Home's wildlife resembles that which would be found in a hemiboreal forested area.</p>

<ul>
 <li><u>In Town:</u> various birds, insects, and rodents such as rats and mice.</li>

 <li>
  <u>Outside of Town:</u> All wildlife found in Town, plus The Farm has a coop of 60 egg-laying hens, 10 roosters, 12 dairy cows, 2 bulls, a flock of
  20 sheep and 5 goats. Hawks and other raptors have been spotted, as well as deer, rabbits, racoons, and game fowl. There are also a pack of feral
  cats that live in the barn.

 <li>
  <u>The Blank:</u> All wildlife found in Town and Outside of Town plus predatory animals such as stoats, weasels, martens, wolverines, foxes, wolves,
  mountain lions and bears. There are a few moose. Most of these animals have a natural fear of humans, but they will attack if startled, cornered, or
  protecting their young. Some more aggressive animals deeper in The Blank will attack to defend their territory.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 There are no dogs or horses in Home. A few people have "pets" due to their knowledge of how to tame wild animals, but this is exceptionally rare.
 Those who live on The Farm may have interactions with the wildlife that lives there, but the cats are afraid of humans and must be tamed via a
 miracle, artifact, or ability.
</p>

<p>
 There are fish in the River that runs through Home: minnows, salmon, various trout species and rock fish. The River also has frogs, salamanders and
 ducks.
