<h1>Reward Points</h1>

<p>
 Welcome Home has a points system that allows characters to obtain random items, skills, additional character slots, and thread interventions by
 staff. You receive <span class="color-scd">1 point</span> per thread reply, and <span class="color-scd">2 points</span> per thread started.
</p>

<p>You can view the store <a href="?act=store">here</a>.</p>
<p>
 <span class="color-scd">All items gained by points cannot be used in any present thread or applied to any thread set in the past.</span>
 For example, if the current site time is October 2023, you cannot make a thread in which your character possesses an item/power in August 2023. You
 may only use your new ability/items in threads that you make
 <span class="color-scd">after</span> you have gained the item/power/etc.
</p>
