<h1>Premise</h1>

<p>
 On January 18, 2023, a series of disappearances occurred throughout the day and night. People who were supposed to die... didn't. In the moment just
 prior to their death -- in the moment before that rattly last breath in the hospital bed, before the car wrapped itself around the telephone pole,
 before the bullet tore through flesh and bone -- people vanished completely.
</p>

<p>
 They woke up in a strange bed someplace else, a mock-up village set in a pastoral, temperate valley surrounded by mountains, a forest, and nothing
 else whatsoever. Everything was unoccupied and untouched, with no evidence of prior residence. There was no one but the newly arrived: no neighboring
 towns, and no government or infrastructure to be found.
</p>

<p>
 However, there were homes: tidy rows of white picket fence homes dotting the hillsides. Inside, furniture and clothes and appliances were waiting.
 Those appliances? Running on electricity with no traceable source. The taps? Running water with no water tanks. There was everything anyone might
 need to start a new life, inexplicably provided, mysteriously functioning.
</p>

<p>
 After the panic and dust settled, in the weeks that followed, the new residents exchanged tenuous explanations for their circumstances. Some have
 argued they are in purgatory, or that everyone is experiencing some sort of mass hallucination. Many have settled into the uneasy belief that they
 have been taken here by a supernatural force, be it a god, a demon, or something else entirely, and that it is watching them.
</p>

<p>Even now. This very moment.</p>

<p>
 Trapped inside this idyllic sketch of a town, calling this new place Home, the residents have been given an opportunity to build a new society.
 Hopefully they'll put on a good show. After all, they <i>are</i> being watched.

<h3>A Very Fun Fun Time Masquerade Ball</h3>

<p>
 On August 1, 2023, a masquerade ball was thrown at The Hanging Gardens to celebrate the arrival of Cheryl Davis, and her long-awaited reunion with
 her sister, Cheyenne.
</p>

<p>
 While the first part of the evening went marvelously, with much merriment all around, tragedy struck as the party dwindled late into the evening. The
 lights in all of Home went out, plunging everything into darkness. Those who were not tucked securely into their beds were hunted by four enormous
 black wolves who could imitate the voices of Homeâ€™s residents and lead their prey astray.
</p>

<p>
 Through the valiant efforts of The Council and The Commune, the wolves were defeated, but not without significant cost. As a grim reminder of the
 night's events, a morgue appears beside the clinic the next day.
</p>

<p>As the residents of Home clean up the carnage, one thing is clear: things will not go back to the way they were before.</p>
