<h1>Application FAQ</h1>

<p><b>Do I have to use a faceclaim?</b></p>

<p>
 No. You can have a character description in lieu of a faceclaim in your shipper, and use “aesthetic” images or a moodboard in lieu of profile
 pictures.
</p>

<p><b>Are there any rules about using face claims?</b></p>

<p>
 No faceclaims of anyone under 18. Don't use a faceclaim if you are aware they've asked for their likeness not to be used. Only actors, models and
 musicians are allowed. No YouTube personalities, influencers, etc. Do not use any civilian photos from social media.
</p>

<p><b>Can I play a child character?</b></p>

<p>Yes. If you would like to play a child, please use character descriptions and a moodboard or aesthetic images.</p>

<p><b>Are there want ads?</b></p>

<p>Technically yes, but only if the characters died together. Anything else should be worked into a plot hook.</p>

<h1>Application Information</h1>

<p>
 The information you enter for your character under the application is up to you: you can tell us as much or as little about your character as you'd
 like. You can even lie.
</p>
<p>
 Think about your character profile as public knowledge about your character. If your character has secrets, you are allowed to protect them. But
 secrets can be hard to keep.
</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>
 Here's where you'd put any <u>public</u> information about your character's powers, such as those granted by an ability or an artifact. You are
 allowed to "bluff" by listing powers your character doesn't have, or you can omit powers/weaknesses your character does have if you intend to keep it
 a secret.
</p>
<h2>Freeform</h2>
<p>
 Please provide a minimum of 200 words but no more than 1,000 words. Include information about how your character died as well as what they have done
 in the year since their arrival in Home. You do not need to include "backstory" about your character's life before they came to Home. You can be
 truthful in your freeform, or treat this as your character's "cover story" -- the image they project to the public.
</p>
<h2>Plot Hooks</h2>
<p>
 Please include three plot hooks that can start the plotting process! These can be relationships, plot events, etc., to help connect your character to
 other characters in Home.
</p>
<h2>The Truth</h2>
<p>
 The Truth section should include the following: your character's gift (if it is not accurately reflected in your public profile), a full detailing of
 their powers/weaknesses (if applicable), and your character's cause of death (if different than that detailed in their freeform.) Anything else that
 isn't true can be revealed through plotting.
</p>
