<h1>Gifts</h1>
<p>Every resident of Home has been bestowed with a gift.</p>

<h2>Miracles</h2>
<p>
 The most common gift received by the residents of Home, a miracle can be as simple as instantly learning a new language or skill, or as complicated
 as curing a character's cancer or turning back the clock on character's life so that they are now years — or even decades — younger.
</p>
<p>Miracles are capped at <span class="color-scd">two per character</span>.</p>

<h2>Artifacts</h2>
<p>
 Strange objects with special properties, some residents have been gifted an artifact. Each artifact is unique. While they grant the wielder special
 advantages, artifacts have a major downside, which is that they can be taken and wielded by anyone. This gives people who have known artifacts a
 target on their back. Better keep it secret.
</p>
<p>
 <u>Example Artifact:</u>
 <i>
  a coin-sized green stone with a hole in the middle. When rubbed three times, it prevents someone from lying to the wielder for the duration of one
  conversation. The artifact has an indeterminate “cool down” period after the conversation, during which it will not work.
 </i>
</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>
 The rarest gift, some residents have been gifted with supernatural abilities. While these abilities are wondrous, they each come with a price tag
 attached, often paid in blood. The Watcher is more likely to provide gifts to those who would abuse their power.
</p>
<p>Abilities are capped at <span class="color-scd">one per character</span>.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b>Can all my characters have an ability/artifact?</b></p>

<p>You are limited to two characters who have an ability or artifact, unless you trade points for an additional character slot.</p>

<p><b>Can my character have both an artifact and an ability/miracle?</b></p>

<p>
 A character would <u>not</u> arrive with <i>both</i> an artifact and an ability/miracle. However, a character may obtain an artifact after arriving
 in home by stealing an artifact or being gifted one. This is <u>only</u> available through points purchase, or if the player of a character with an
 artifact agrees to give it to your character. Characters who are going to be retired are not allowed to give away their artifacts.
</p>

<p><b>Can my character steal back their stolen artifact?</b></p>

<p>Yes, you can trade points for this. It will cost one half the usual amount of points for a character to steal an artifact.</p>

<p><b>What is a miracle, and what are the rules about giving one to my character?</b></p>

<p>
 A miracle is an unnatural event that affects your character. This could be as complex as making a character fifty years younger, curing cancer,
 restoring an amputated limb, etc. It could be as simple as your character waking up with new, intricate knowledge of a subject, such as a new
 language, or the ability to carve wood very well.
</p>

<p>Your character can experience any type of miracle, so long as it could not be considered an ability.</p>

<p><b>What is an artifact? What are the rules about giving one to my character?</b></p>

<p>
 An artifact is an object with strange properties that must be activated with some type of gesture. Artifacts function very similarly to abilities,
 but with less dramatic costs. However, the weaknesses of artifacts is that they can be taken from a character.
</p>

<p>The rules surrounding artifacts is that they need to have a way to be activated, and they must have a cooldown period where they can't be used.</p>

<p><b>How does a character know what an artifact does?</b></p>

<p>
 Upon touching an artifact, the character will know how to activate it and what the artifact does. They will not immediately know the cooldown period.
 This applies to anyone who touches the artifact, not just the person it was initially given to.
</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>What is an ability, and what are the rules about giving one to my character?</b></p>

<p>
 An ability is an unnatural power wielded by a character. Abilities can be extraordinarily powerful, but will always come at a cost. The Watcher is
 more likely to grant abilities to characters who would have a predisposition to abuse their power.
</p>

<p><b>What is the process for purchasing an ability/artifact/skill for my character?</b></p>

<p>Step One: Purchase the ability/artifact/skill from the store</p>
<p>Step Two: Submit your ability/artifact/skill for approval</p>
<p>Step Three: 'Use' the artifact/ability/skill in your inventory</p>
<p>
 Step Four: Add the ability/artifact/skill to your profile. You must label the ability/artifact/skill as purchased in the profile, either in the
 designated secret section, or under the 'powers' section.
