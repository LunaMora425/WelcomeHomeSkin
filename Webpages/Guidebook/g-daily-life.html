<h1>Daily Life</h1>

<p>
	<b>Utilities:</b> Home, strangely, has electricity, even though there is no infrastructure to maintain it. Flip the
	light switch on the wall, and the room will be filled with light, even if the bulb has long since burnt out, and the
	lamp isn't plugged in. However, the only electric devices that will work are lamps and kitchen appliances, and only in
	the buildings that were already there when the residents arrived. Trash cans are self emptying.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Water:</b> Much like electricity, all preexisting homes have running water. There are no water tanks or
	understandable source for the water, nor any sensible explanation for how sewage and plumbing are operating.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Furnishings:</b> Homes come furnished, but supplies are limited. Items may or may not restock themselves at random.
	Residents would be aware that supplies are limited and behave accordingly. Do not use the random regeneration ability
	to give your character unbounded material security: apply it judicially and in-line with the idea that items exist,
	but not at the gratuitous industrial level.
</p>
<p>
	Houses have identical layouts but variations in furnishings. There are no books in the houses. There is no air
	conditioning, but there is heating.

<p>
	<b>Communication:</b> Cell phones won't work in Home. They will have no signal. Radios do work, though there's not
	much to listen to. There are no computers.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Transportation:</b> Home does not currently have any form of automated transportation, i.e. no trolleys, no cars,
	no trains. A handful of residents have bicycles in their possession.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Materials:</b> At this time there is a lack of industrial-level production, so all materials are made by hand and
	take some time to produce. There are some instances where specific objects can be retrieved from Earth by supernatural
	means, but usually residents have to make do with the limited resources available.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Food:</b> The majority of Home's agriculture is grown at The Commune. Most meat is obtained by hunting in The
	Blank. Town has limited access to animal products such as milk, honey, and eggs, so these come at a premium. There is
	a river, and fish in that river.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Clothes:</b> Along with the clothes they were wearing, each resident was given 5 sets of Home-provided clothes: a
	full outfit (undergarments and shoes included) for Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and pajamas/loungewear. The new
	outfits were made from natural materials such as cotton, flax, wool and leather. While there are means and materials
	to make additional items of clothing, it's time consuming and therefore expensive, so most residents visit a tailor to
	have their clothing mended if need be.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Medicine:</b> Town has a small medical clinic restricted by rudimentary tools. There are, however, alternative ways
	to heal an ailment.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Currency:</b> Home operates on the barter/credit system. Residents who don't have something to offer find
	themselves reliant on charity that may not be so charitable.
