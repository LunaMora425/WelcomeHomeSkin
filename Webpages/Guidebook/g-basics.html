<h1>Daily Life</h1>

<p>
 <u>Utilities:</u> Home, strangely, has electricity, even though there is no infrastructure to maintain it. Flip the light switch on the wall, and the
 room will be filled with light, even if the bulb has long since burnt out, and the lamp isn't plugged in. However, the only electric devices that
 will work are lamps and kitchen appliances, and only in the buildings that were already there when the residents arrived. Trash cans are self
 emptying.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Water:</u> Much like electricity, all preexisting homes have running water. There are no water tanks or understandable source for the water, nor
 any sensible explanation for how sewage and plumbing are operating.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Furnishings:</u> Homes come furnished, but supplies are limited. Items may or may not restock themselves at random. Residents would be aware that
 supplies are limited and behave accordingly. Do not use the random regeneration ability to give your character unbounded material security: apply it
 judicially and in-line with the idea that items exist, but not at the gratuitous industrial level.
</p>

<p>
 Houses have identical layouts but variations in furnishings. There are no books in the houses. There is no air conditioning, but there is heating.

<p>
 <u>Communication:</u> Cell phones won't work in Home. They will have no signal. Radios would technically work, though there are no broadcasting
 stations, and only Town Hall has a radio. There are no computers.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Transportation:</u> Home does not currently have any form of automated transportation, i.e. no trolleys, no cars, no trains. A handful of
 residents have bicycles in their possession.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Materials:</u> At this time there is a lack of industrial-level production, so all materials are made by hand and take some time to produce. There
 are some instances where specific objects can be retrieved from Earth by supernatural means, but usually residents have to make do with the limited
 resources available.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Food:</u> The majority of Home's agriculture is grown at The Commune. Most meat is obtained by hunting in The Blank. Town has limited access to
 animal products such as milk, honey, and eggs, so these come at a premium. There is a river, and fish in that river.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Clothes:</u> Along with the clothes they were wearing, each resident was given 5 sets of Home-provided clothes: a full outfit (undergarments and
 shoes included) for Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and pajamas/loungewear. The new outfits were made from natural materials such as cotton, flax, wool
 and leather. While there are means and materials to make additional items of clothing, it's time consuming and therefore expensive, so most residents
 visit a tailor to have their clothing mended if need be.
</p>

<p><u>Medicine:</u> Town has a small medical clinic restricted by rudimentary tools. There are, however, alternative ways to heal an ailment.</p>

<p><u>Currency:</u> Home has no established currency.</p>

<h2>The Economy</h2>

<h3>Town</h3>

<p>
 <u>Rations:</u> If you are resident of Town, you are given weekly rations free of charge by the Council. You do not need to work for these rations,
 but it is <span class="color-scd">strongly encouraged</span>. Slackers will find themselves increasingly socially pressured and their neighbors
 displeased.
</p>

<p>
 <u>Labor:</u> Generally, in exchange for rations, all members of Town work. In this sense,
 <span class="color-scd">no one in Town pays one another for their services beyond optional tipping</span>. The Council is already paying you through
 your rations to contribute to Town. Tipping with a personal possession is nice, but not mandatory. Naturally, gift giving is still encouraged. Side
 jobs/side hustles also create space for bonus exchange, but if you're caught 'charging' for the labor the Council 'paid' you for, you will be
 complained about.
</p>

<p>
 The people who work in Town contribute proceeds of their labor to the Council, which uses them to trade en masse with the Commune. These acquisitions
 by the Council are what is distributed as rations.
</p>

<p>Seasonally, residents of Town may be called onto the Farm to help with the harvest. Otherwise, they labor in Town.</p>

<h3>The Commune</h3>

<p>
 At the Commune, people are able to benefit more directly from their own labor. The Commune has better
 <span class="color-scd"> pooling of resources and labor,</span> as well as more communal living. They are able to enjoy small luxuries such as eating
 a peach right off a tree -- the freshest peach! -- as opposed to accepting whatever rations are doled out by the Council. The Commune also has access
 to the free, high-quality medical care of Leyla's healing touch and overall the more liberal practices one might imagine of a communal situation.
