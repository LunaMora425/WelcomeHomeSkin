<h1>Locations</h1>
<h2>Town</h2>
<p><b>Population: 998</b></p>

<p>
 The residents have built upon the skeleton of Town to form functional
 community, albeit one without some of the modern amenities residents had become
 accustomed to. Town sits in a valley with arable land and is surrounded on four
 sides by the mountainous woodlands known as The Blank. Town consists of two
 areas: The Residences, where residents live, and Main Street, a series of
 shops, governmental buildings and the Town Square.
</p>

<p>Notable Main Street locations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <u>Town Square:</u> The center of main street, the Town Square is a lively
  public space with benches and shady trees. A major source of activity in Town.
  Later in the day into the evening, Town Square may be filled with vendors
  trading and bartering, street buskers and some Council-sanctioned events.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Town Hall:</u> The only two-story building in Home. The Town Hall houses
  The council room, offices for all of Town Hall's employees including those of
  the councilors, the sheriff, and the deputies, a small jail with two cells,
  the record room and a large atrium that functions as a communal meeting space.
 </li>
 <li><u>The Clinic:</u> A rudimentary clinic, with basic tools.</li>
 <li>
  <u>The Morgue:</u> (New as of Aug 1, 2023). A small building located to the
  left of Town Hall, the morgue consists of an autopsy table and cadaver
  storage, with rudimentary tools. The morgue is monitored by Town's part-time
  coroner, Valerian Ellis.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>The Distillery:</u> An intimate bar and distillery run by Councilman Clay.
  The Distillery opened in June, and has been providing residences with liquor
  of questionable quality. Currently, the supplies for mash have been supplied
  by The Watcher, but The Distillery has had to occasionally close after selling
  out of liquor in order to wait for mash ingredients to periodically restock.
  The Distillery has a small stage for local performers.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Notable Residences locations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <u>The Hanging Gardens:</u> A block of 18 houses to the south of Town Hall,
  bordering No Man's Land, with their siding and doors decorated with painted
  green vines and various flowers. These are the pleasure houses in Town, the
  Red Light District, full of a mixture of pleasures and vices that can be found
  in Home, ranging from sex work to psychedelic research. Also home of artisans
  and craftspeople who can work with the materials that Cheyenne Davis can
  transmutate and work with her on her projects.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Le Restaurant:</u> (New as of Sep 1, 2023) A house in No-Man's Land which
  has had the bedroom furniture removed and replaced with 6 indoor dining tables
  and 4 outdoor dining tables. When it's nice out, more of the tables are moved
  outside. Each table is decorated with chamomile flowers and a wooden board
  menu, with the available dishes designated with calligraphy. The restaurant is
  marked by a wooden sign hanging to the top right of the door that says 'Le
  Restaurant'.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Notable locations outside of Town:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <u>Memorial Cemetery Park:</u> A park erected in The Meadows after the
  slaughter on the night of the Masquerade Ball. Consists of 33 grave sites that
  residents may visit to mourn, or to celebrate life.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Commune</h2>
<p><b>Population: 340</b></p>

<p>
 The compound of Saint Leyla and her adherents, The Commune is on the west side
 of Town. The Commune is responsible for nearly all of the agriculture in Home,
 so they have a tenuous relationship with the other residents of Town, who in
 turn provide many of the goods and services that the members of The Commune
 require. Anyone is welcome to join The Commune, and in exchange receive shelter
 and three meals a day. There's just one thing they ask in returnâ€¦
</p>

<p>Notable Commune locations:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <u>Leyla's Residence:</u> The center home on the row of homes closest to The
  Meadows, Leyla's home looks out onto The Farm. Leyla has a porch swing on her
  patio.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>No Man's Land:</u> the blocks immediately surrounding the Commune have been
  abandoned by Town so there is a dead zone/buffer between Commune and Town
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Farm</h2>
<p>
 Run by The Commune, The Farm is to the west of Town. Here, there are fields,
 gardens, an orchard and plenty of pasture. The Farm has a coop of 60 egg-laying
 hens, 10 roosters, 12 dairy cows, 2 bulls, a flock of 20 sheep and 5 goats. The
 Farm was collectively managed by the people of the Town until St. Leyla and her
 cult instituted a hostile takeover of the Farm.
