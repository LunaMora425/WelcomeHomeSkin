<h1>Town Locations</h1>
<h2>Town</h2>
<p><b>Population: 998</b></p>
<p>
	The residents have built upon the skeleton of Town to form functional community, albeit one without some of the modern
	amenities residents had become accustomed to. Town sits in a valley with arable land and is surrounded on four sides
	by the mountainous woodlands known as The Blank. Town consists of two areas: The Residences, where residents live, and
	Main Street, a series of shops, governmental buildings and the Town Square.
</p>
<p>Notable Main Street locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Town Square</li>
	<li>Town Hall</li>
	<li>The Clinic</li>
	<li>The Morgue (new as of Aug 1, 2023)</li>
	<li>The Distillery</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable Residences locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Hanging Gardens</li>
	<li>Memorial Cemetery Park</li>
	<li>Le Restaurant</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Commune</h2>
<p><b>Population: 340</b></p>
<p>
	The compound of Saint Leyla and her adherents, The Commune is on the west side of Town. The Commune is responsible for
	nearly all of the agriculture in Home, so they have a tenuous relationship with the other residents of Town, who in
	turn provide many of the goods and services that the members of The Commune require. Anyone is welcome to join The
	Commune, and in exchange receive shelter and three meals a day. There's just one thing they ask in returnâ€¦
</p>
<p>Notable Commune locations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Leyla's Residence</li>
	<li>
		No Man's Land: the blocks immediately surrounding the Commune have been abandoned by Town so there is a dead
		zone/buffer between Commune and Town
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Farm</h2>
<p>
	Run by The Commune, The Farm is to the west of Town. Here, there are fields, gardens, an orchard and plenty of
	pasture. The Farm has a coop of 60 egg-laying hens, 10 roosters, 12 dairy cows, 2 bulls, a flock of 20 sheep and 5
	goats. The Farm was collectively managed by the people of the Town until St. Leyla and her cult instituted a hostile
	takeover of the Farm.
