<h2>Town</h2>
<p><b>Population: 998</b></p>

<p>
 The residents have built upon the skeleton of Town to form functional community, albeit one without some of the modern amenities residents had become
 accustomed to. Town sits in a valley with arable land and is surrounded on four sides by the mountainous woodlands known as The Blank. Town consists
 of two areas: The Residences, where residents live, and Main Street, a series of shops, governmental buildings and the Town Square.
</p>

<p>Notable Main Street locations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <u>Town Square:</u> The center of main street, the Town Square is a lively public space with benches and shady trees. A major source of activity in
  Town. Later in the day into the evening, Town Square may be filled with vendors trading and bartering, street buskers and some Council-sanctioned
  events.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Town Hall:</u> The only two-story building in Home. The Town Hall houses The council room, offices for all of Town Hall's employees including
  those of the councilors, the sheriff, and the deputies, a small jail with two cells, the record room and a large atrium that functions as a communal
  meeting space.
 </li>
 <li><u>The Clinic:</u> A rudimentary clinic, with basic tools.</li>
 <li>
  <u>The Morgue:</u> (New as of Aug 1, 2023). A small building located to the left of Town Hall, the morgue consists of an autopsy table and cadaver
  storage, with rudimentary tools. The morgue is monitored by Town's part-time coroner, Valerian Ellis.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>The Distillery:</u> An intimate bar and distillery run by Councilman Clay. The Distillery opened in June, and has been providing residences with
  liquor of questionable quality. Currently, the supplies for mash have been supplied by The Watcher, but The Distillery has had to occasionally close
  after selling out of liquor in order to wait for mash ingredients to periodically restock. The Distillery has a small stage for local performers.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Notable Residences locations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <u>The Hanging Gardens:</u> A block of 18 houses to the south of Town Hall, bordering No Man's Land, with their siding and doors decorated with
  painted green vines and various flowers. These are the pleasure houses in Town, the Red Light District, full of a mixture of pleasures and vices
  that can be found in Home, ranging from sex work to psychedelic research. Also home of artisans and craftspeople who can work with the materials
  that Cheyenne Davis can transmutate and work with her on her projects.
 </li>
 <li>
  <u>Le Restaurant:</u> (New as of Sep 1, 2023) A house in No-Man's Land which has had the bedroom furniture removed and replaced with 6 indoor dining
  tables and 4 outdoor dining tables. When it's nice out, more of the tables are moved outside. Each table is decorated with chamomile flowers and a
  wooden board menu, with the available dishes designated with calligraphy. The restaurant is marked by a wooden sign hanging to the top right of the
  door that says 'Le Restaurant'.
