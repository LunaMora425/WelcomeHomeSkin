<h1>Rules</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<ol>
 <li>
  <b>Players must be 18 or older to join.</b> Welcome Home (WHRP) is an 18+ RPG on Jcink Premium. Anyone found to be in violation of the age rule will
  be removed from the roleplay and the server immediately.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>If you have an issue with another player or player(s), keep it out of the server/off the site.</b> If you have an issue with something said in
  the server/on the site, operate on good faith and express your concerns clearly. Address issues with one another with clear communication before
  coming to staff. It's fine not to like everyone, but don't let that ruin everyone's enjoyment of the roleplay.
 </li>
 <p>
  If you bring drama into the server you will receive one warning. If it happens again, you will be kicked from the discord server and your characters
  will be archived.
 </p>
</ol>

<h2>Roleplay Guidelines</h2>

<ol>
 <li>
  <b>Be a good roleplayer.</b> No powerplaying, godmoding or metagaming. In-character interactions between characters don't have to be equal, but they
  should be fair.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>Threads/scenes are open to all other roleplayers by default.</b> All scenes that take place in a public area (not inside a character's home) will
  be considered an <b>open</b> scene that any character can join at any time.
 </li>
 <ul>
  <li>
   For those joining an open scene, please be mindful of the current standard set for the scene (mood, level of post descriptiveness, etc.) and make
   sure your entry is coherent.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <li>
  <b>Threads operate on liquid time.</b> A character can be in more than one thread at once. However, threads must still follow a set timeline.
  Characters can't be in two places at once. Players are responsible for maintaining their characters' timelines.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>In-character actions have in-character consequences.</b> Every action, inaction, and reaction a character makes can affect other characters.
  However, characters cannot be irreversibly harmed or killed without player consent. Open communication between players is absolutely key. Please
  respect players' characters and their plots on all fronts.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>You may have up to two characters to start the game with.</b>
 </li>
 <ul>
  <li>
   You may apply for an additional character if you have not had an activity check in the last month, or more than one hiatus in the last three
   months.
  </li>
  <li>There is a limit of five characters per player. Additional character slots past five can be purchased with points.</li>
  <li>
   If you do not qualify for an additional character, you may retire a character in exchange for a new character. You may not "swap" back and forth
   between retired characters, so be mindful when you retire a character.
  </li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<h2>Content</h2>

<ol>
 <li>
  <b>
   WHRP is a 3-3-3 site that allows <u>all</u> content permitted by Jcink's
   <a href="https://jcink.com/index.php?p=jfh_terms_premium" target="_blank">Premium Terms of Services</a> to be roleplayed.
  </b>
  This includes objectionable and mature language, graphic sexual content, and extreme graphic violence. Strongly consider if this is the site for you
  before joining.
 </li>
 <li><b>Tagging content warnings is not required.</b> Onlookers read at your own risk.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <b> Scenes that include graphic violence, heavy topics such as abuse, or sexual content should be in the NSFW forum for each location. </b>
   Whether a scene belongs under NSFW is up to writer discretion, but err on the side of caution.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>
    While content warnings are not required, it is good manners to check in with your scene partner(s) to discuss any potentially heavy content, even
    if it's not in their limits.
   </b>
  </li>
 </ul>
</ol>

  <li>You must post at least once per character, or have an open looking-for-roleplay request each activity cycle.</li>
  <li>Any threads that have no posts after seven days will be archived.</li>
  <li>You have three days after being put on activity check to respond to your scenes, or to close your scenes.</li>
