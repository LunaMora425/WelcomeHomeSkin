<h1>Arrival</h1>

<p>
	All residents of Home share the same date of death: January 18th, 2023. However, people did not arrive in Home at the
	same time. The earliest day of arrival would be January 19th, 2023. People have been arriving ever since, and new
	residents continue to slowly arrive. All residents wake up in a bed in a two-bedroom home. They have no knowledge or
	understanding of how they got there.
</p>
<p>
	Residents would arrive in the clothes they died in, minus any damage to that clothing (burns, slashes) that occurred
	at the time of death. They would arrive with the personal effects on them at the time of their death (jewelry, wallet,
	cell phone, etc.) Note that cell phones do not work in Home.
</p>

<h2>In what state would my character arrive in Home?</h2>

<p>
	Your character was taken before the moment of their death. This means that whatever would have killed them didn't
	happen. Here are a few examples:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<u>Your character would have died of multiple stab wounds.</u> Your character would not have the stab wound that
		would have killed them, but may still have other minor defensive wounds, such as a cut on the arm or hand.
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>Your character would have died of organ failure.</u> The organ that was failing would be restored to good health.
		However, any preexisting conditions that led to the failure, such as old age or cancer, would still affect your
		character, unless they experienced a miracle.
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>Your character would have died in a car accident.</u> Your character may have some minor cuts and scrapes from
		broken glass, or a concussion, but would not experience the killing blow.
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>Your character would have died of a gunshot wound.</u> Your character would not have been shot. They would arrive
		in good physical health.
	</li>

	<li>
		<u>Your character would have died in a fire.</u> They may arrive with lung damage from smoke inhalation, or minor
		burns, but would not experience deadly burns.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What buildings existed when the Residents first arrived at Home?</h2>

<p>
	Home had enough houses if they were each shared between two people. Due to some residents leaving Town for The
	Commune, there are now some people who live alone.

	<br />For more detailed information, please see <a href="?showtopic=210">YOUR HOUSE IN HOME</a> lore doc.
</p>

<p>
	There is also a "Main Street" and a "Town Square" with small buildings equipped with electricity, running water, and,
	at times, important equipment. These buildings are occupied by Home's most useful businesses: metalworkers,
	carpenters, butchers, glassworkers, medical providers, etc.
</p>

<p>The only building in Town to have 2 floors is Town Hall.</p>

<p>Additionally, west of Town is farmland with one barn, a pasture, and an orchard.</p>
