<h1>Welcome Home</h1>

<p>
	Welcome Home is a paranormal horror roleplay set after a rapture event in which over a thousand people were
	transported to a mysterious town under the watching eye of an unknown being. The town is mysteriously blessed with
	basic technology, and the people have learned to provide for their collective needs. Some people have been granted
	supernatural powers; others experienced miracles such as healing of an illness, the return of their youth, or the
	understanding of a new language. But not one of them knows why they are here.
</p>

<p>Certainly no one knows how to get out.</p>
